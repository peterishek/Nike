This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Nike-style eCommerce built with Devin AI, Next.js, Drizzle ORM, and Better Auth. In this project, you’ll master prompting as Devin helps generate sleek product pages powered by Next.js 15, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The backend runs on Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, authentication is handled with Better Auth, and Zustand manages state — all packaged in a clean, modular UI to help you ship faster.



⚙️ Tech Stack

- **[Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)** is a framework-agnostic authentication and authorization library for TypeScript. It provides built-in support for email and password authentication, social sign-on (Google, GitHub, Apple, and more), and multi-factor authentication, simplifying user authentication and account management.

- **[Devin AI](https://docs.devin.ai/get-started/devin-intro)** is an autonomous AI software engineer by Cognition Labs that independently plans, writes, debugs, and deploys full applications from natural language prompts. It integrates with tools like Slack, Linear, and Jira to manage tasks and pull requests, and learns new technologies on the fly by reading documentation.

- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** is a lightweight and performant TypeScript ORM designed with developer experience in mind. It provides a seamless interface between application code and database operations while maintaining high performance and reliability.

- **[Neon](https://neon.com/)** is a fully managed, serverless PostgreSQL database platform. It offers features like instant provisioning, autoscaling, and database branching, enabling developers to build scalable applications without managing infrastructure.

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)** is a powerful React framework for building full-stack web applications. It simplifies development with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, enabling developers to focus on building products and shipping quickly.

- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom, responsive designs quickly without leaving their HTML. It provides pre-defined classes for layout, typography, colors, and more.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection for developers. It is ideal for building large-scale applications and enhances the development experience.

- **[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs)** is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.
